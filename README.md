1.) Relative paths are relative to the current working directory. <br>
2.) Absolute paths start with the root folder, such as / or C:\ <br>
3.) os.getcwd() returns the current working directory. <br>
os.chdir() changes current working directory. <br>
4.) The . folder is the current folder, the .. is the parent folder. <br>
5.) C:\bacon\eggs is dir, while spam. txt is the base name. <br>
6.) The string 'r' for read mode, 'w' for write mode, and 'a' for append mode. <br>
7.) An existing file opened in write mode is erased and completely overwritten. <br>
8.) The read() method returns the file's entire contents as a single string value. The readlines() method returns a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file's contents. <br>
9.) A shelf value is like a dictionary values; it has keys and values, along with keys() and values() methods that work similarly to the dictionary methods of the same names.<br>
